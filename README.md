How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that code and software are both functional and secure, various testing approaches should be applied, such as unit testing to verifies individual components, and integration testing to ensure that different modules work well together. 
we can also use a Functional testing to checks if the software meets user and business requirements. Additionally, security testing is crucial to identify vulnerabilities and protect against potential threats.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, it's essential to gather and analyze requirements through direct communication with users, stakeholders, or by reviewing business objectives. 
Techniques like user interviews, surveys, and feedback help understand their goals and points, these requirements can be translated into functional specifications.

How do I approach designing software?

To design software, we need to break down the application into smaller components or modules, choose appropriate design patterns, and ensure the design accommodates future changes.
It's also important to create wireframes for the user interface and establish a clear workflow for how users will interact with the system. Regularly reviewing and refining the design ensures it meets both technical and user requirements.
